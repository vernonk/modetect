#Mo' Detect

##Description

Mo' Detect exists to give a different approach to device detection.  This rather small library makes it easy to:  

  - Make testing Android phones vs. tablets more reliable.
  - Tests based on window.navigator.userAgent and .platform with regex patterns
  - Device resolution
  - Device OS major version comparison "match", "greaterThan", "lessThan"
  - Subtests so that you can do more specific detection.
